# Setting up Tableau Cloud

- You arrive on the main page of the Tableau online version
- Here you can publish and connect to the data source etc.


# For Mongo DB integration

- Mongo DB Atlas Integration in the Tableau cloud is not directly available in Tableau's online version.
- We can connect Tableau Desktop with the Tableau Online version with the Mongo Db's Bi connector Tool
- We also have the option to connect the same through ODBC but haven't figured it out myself yet!
